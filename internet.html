<p>In the Internet age, most of information is available on the Internet in the different
formats which known as “Internet resources” and people use Internet information for
their different purposes but it is very essential for every Internet user to evaluate the
retrieved Internet resources before making their uses to accomplish the tasks. This

resources by authors. This study will assist to users in framing the evaluation criteria

<p>Too much of information is available on Internet but there is no uniform way
by which reliability and authenticity of Internet resources can be judged. It is
important to remember that anyone can publish on the Internet and of course it is
easier to find and access the published information on the Internet. This means that
the quality of the information one finds on the net must be evaluated very carefully.
For a journal article to be published in traditional media, it usually goes through some
peer review before it is accepted for publication. With a book one can judge quality by
the reputation of the publisher, author, series and so on. However, the flood of raw
information on the Internet has not been filtered by peer review or the collaborative
efforts of the traditional publishing industr.
